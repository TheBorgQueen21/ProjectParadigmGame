Project Paradigm Contest Entry

This is where we are going to be saving our files of code.
Then, we will upload them to atom.io, where we can all work at the same time.


If you want to make a change directly on Github for some reason, then you can click the pencil button on the file you want to edit.
Then, make the change on the file and then scroll down. 
There, you can add information about what you changed and why you did it (it helps us keep organized).


There are two options at the bottom of the screen. 
First, there is one that says: Commit directly to the master branch.
This is when you want to edit something directly to the actual file.

The other option that says:  Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.
This is when you want to create a copy of the file.

To save your changes, click Commit Changes.

***Commit means to create a change to the code***
